Msg: Unknown command 'debootstrap'
Command: debootstrap
# In Windows or so, it might make sense to have "GUI steps" instead of 'Command'.
Solution1: Get debootstrap from <http://packages.debian.org/squeeze/all/debootstrap/download>. `ar -x debootstrap.deb`. `tar -xzvf data.tar.gz -C /`.

Msg: E: No pkgdetails available; either install perl, or build pkgdetails.c from source
Command: debootstrap
Solution1: Get perl-base from <http://ftp.us.debian.org/debian/pool/main/p/perl/>. `ar -x perl-base*.deb`. `tar -xzvf data.tar.gz -C /`.
Solution2: Install ipkg. Install perl via ipkg. Symlink `/usr/bin/perl`.
# Solution* should be a list/set. And it might make sense to have other attributes. Like that the second solution only works if ipkg can be installed somehow. The first solution also very probably doesn't work on non-Debian-like systems.

Msg: E: Unknown compression type for  in .//var/cache/...
Command: debootstrap
Solution1: Install `ar` via ipkg (binutils package). Symlink `/usr/bin/ar`.

Msg: bash: warning: setlocale: LC_ALL: cannot change locale (en_US.UTF-8)
Command: bash
Solution1: `apt-get install locales`. `dpkg-reconfigure locales` and select "en_US.UTF-8".

Msg: WARNING: The following packages cannot be authenticated
Command: apt-get
Solution1: `apt-get install locales && dpkg-reconfigure locales` and select "en_US_UTF-8" solved this for me. Not sure if that was by some indirect dependencies or what the problem was.

Msg: configure: error: C++ compiler cannot create executables
Command: ./configure
Solution1: `apt-get install build-essential`.

Msg: configure: error: Can't find ext2fs library
Command: ./configure
Solution1: `apt-get install e2fslibs-dev`.
